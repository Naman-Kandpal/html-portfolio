Hi, everyone. I've just taken my first step into the vast world of web development and this my first mini 'project' where I've created a little portfolio web site with the things I have learnt so far. I hope you like it, please feel free share your thoughts/tips/guidance. I can assure you that a lot more is yet to come! Cheers!!
